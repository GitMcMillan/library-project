# library-project

Hello, and welcome to my Authors to Books one-to-many library project for Python. The app is a simple CLI interface for searching through authors and the books that exist within the database, adding new authors or books, are even deleting authors and their books from the database. If necessary, they can be updated as well.

To use the interace, simply fork and clone the repo and within the terminal run "python cli.py". Enjoy!
